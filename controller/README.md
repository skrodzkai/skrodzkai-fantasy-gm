# Yahoo draft controller

This is a dependency-free, page-resident controller for Yahoo NFL live draft rooms. It acts only from a nonempty ordered target ladder, never turns on Yahoo Autodraft, and stores a receipt before every Draft click plus a roster-transition confirmation afterward.

## Safety boundary

- Run only on `/draftclient/f1/<room>/<seat>` after dismissing Yahoo tutorials or dialogs.
- Prefer Yahoo player IDs. The fallback identity requires the exact displayed Yahoo name, position, and team abbreviation.
- On an owned turn Yahoo renders a `Draft` button inside every available player row. The controller clicks only the button inside the uniquely matched target row; it never uses a page-global Draft selector.
- The controller requires both the live `YOUR TURN` document title and the exact `YOUR TURN • ROUND …, PICK …` banner. Static future-pick text is ignored.
- A checked Autodraft control, blocking dialog, ambiguous player, ambiguous Draft action, changed room, unavailable ladder, or unconfirmed roster transition stops the controller.
- A failed room is not recoverable for acceptance. The page-resident controller records the failure and immediately returns to the mock lobby before Yahoo's inactivity clock can make another selection.

## Load and start

Inject `yahoo-draft-controller.js` into the Yahoo draft page, then provide a preapproved ordered ladder:

```js
const controller = SKRODZKaiYahooDraftController.create({
  targets: [
    { yahooId: "31908" },
    { name: "T. McLaurin", position: "WR", team: "Was" },
  ],
});

controller.start();
controller.getStatus();
controller.exportReceipts();
```

The controller persists receipts in Yahoo-origin local storage under `skrodzkai-yahoo-draft-controller-receipts-v1`. Injection does not start the controller; `start()` is the explicit execution boundary.

## Verification

```bash
node --test controller/yahoo-draft-controller.test.mjs
```
